# CspReportParser

Plug parser module to handle csp-report bodies.  
Documentation is available on [hex.pm](https://hexdocs.pm/csp_report_parser)

## Installation
The package can be installed by adding `csp_report_parser` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:csp_report_parser, "~> 0.1"}
  ]
end
```

Then just add the parser to your endpoint configuration:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Endpoint do
  # ...
  plug Plug.Parsers,
    parsers: [:urlencoded, :multipart, :json, :csp_report],
    pass: ["*/*"],
    json_decoder: Phoenix.json_library()
  # ...
end
```

## Acknowledgment
The majority of this code is based on the json parser implementation shipped with [Plug](https://github.com/elixir-plug/plug)
